Operative Systems Suported are: Linux-ubuntu, kali-linux, backtack-linux (un-continued), freeBSD, Mac osx (un-continued)  Netool its a toolkit written using 'bash, python, ruby' that allows you to automate frameworks like Nmap, Driftnet, Sslstrip, Metasploit and Ettercap MitM attacks. this toolkit makes it easy tasks such as SNIFFING tcp/udp traffic, Man-In-The-Middle attacks, SSL-sniff, DNS-spoofing, D0S attacks in wan/lan networks, TCP/UDP packet manipulation using etter-filters, and gives you the ability to capture pictures of target webbrowser surfing (driftnet), also uses macchanger to decoy scans changing the mac address.  Rootsector module allows you to automate some attacks over DNS_SPOOF + MitM (phishing - social engineering) using metasploit, apache2 and ettercap frameworks. Like the generation of payloads, shellcode, backdoors delivered using dns_spoof and MitM method to redirect a target to your phishing webpage. recent as introducted the scanner inurlbr (by cleiton)

|                  The reazon why i did the tool                     |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
 Iam a white hat, developer, pentester, blogger, so i dont like to harm
 people , if you take a closer look to my 'netool.sh' you will notest
 that allmost all attacks are performed inside Local Lan using (MITM). 


 "a whitehat as the rigth to do what it feel like inside is own
 local network to an intruder... offcourse people can use this tool
 to harm others on local lan (neighbor WIFI), or using it in a Fake-Ap
 (honeypot) but in the begining I did not have develop the tool for that"

 netool.sh [white hat] usage: local lan, pentesting lab
 netool.sh [black hat] usage: honeypot, cybercaffe, neighbor WIFI


 "netool.sh as original develop to show the power of ettercap framework
 and everything related to MITM attacks, also to show how scripting can
 automate things up", netool.sh tool provides a fast and easy way for
 new arrivals to security pentesting as also to experience users to use
 allmost all features that the Man-In-The-Middle can provide...

+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
 netool.sh is a script in bash to automate frameworks like metasploit,
 Nmap, Driftnet, SSLstrip, and Ettercap MITM attacks, Retrieves metadata,
 geo-location of target, as the hability to capture SSL passwords under
 MITM, sniff URL accessed by target machine, changes hostname, change IP
 and Mac-Address to decoy scans, capture pictures of web-browser surfing
 (diftnet), perform TCP/UDP packets manipulation using etter.filters,
 DoS attacks on local/external network, webcrawler.py [scan websites],
 admin page finder, uses the external script (cupp.py) to build a dicionary
 (common password profiler),also a collection of post exploitation modules
 (meterpreter auxiliary) develop by me, a collection of automated exploits
 [r00tsect0r automated exploits] module to have full control of target
 system, at last a module to perform (DNS-Spoof) using Ettercap...
